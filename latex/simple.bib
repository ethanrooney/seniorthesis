abstract = { In a preliminary note (‘Roy. Soc. Proc.’ A, vol. 81, p. 174, 1908) on the above subject, experiments were described which gave direct evidence of the scattering of the α-particles. In those experiments a strong source of α-radiation was placed at one end of a long exhausted tube, and the α-particles, after passing through a narrow slit, fell upon a zinc sulphide screen sealed to the other end of the tube. When the pressure inside the tube was very low, the narrow line of scintillations which marked the place of incidence of the α-particles on the screen was well defined, but when the rays on their way to the screen passed through gas or through thin metal foils the edges of this line of scintillations became indistinct. The amount of scattering could be estimated for different foils by placing them in the path of the rays and noting the distribution of the scintillations on the screen. The present investigation was undertaken with a view to obtain a quantitative measurement of the scattering by determining the most probable angle through which an α-particle of definite range is turned by passing through a given thickness of matter. The following are the chief points investigated:— (1) Determination of the amount of scattering produced in different thicknesses of the same material. (2) Comparison of the amounts of scattering produced in different materials. (3) Relation between the velocity of the α-particles and the amount of their scattering. }

    abstract = { When β-particles fall on a plate, a strong radiation emerges from the same side of the plate as that on which the β-particles fall. This radiation is regarded by many observers as a secondary radiation, but more recent experiments seem to show that it consists mainly of primary β-particles, which have been scattered inside the material to such an extent that they emerge again at the same side of the plate. For α-particles a similar effect has not previously been observed, and is perhaps not to be expected on account of the relatively small scattering which α-particles suffer in penetrating matter. In the following experiments, however, conclusive evidence was found of, the existence of a diffuse reflection of the α-particles. A small fraction of the α-particles falling upon a metal plate have their directions changed to such an extent that they emerge again at the side of incidence. To form an idea of the way in which this effect takes place, the following three points were investigated:— (I) The relative amount of reflection from different metals. (II) The relative amount of reflection from a metal of varying thickness. (Ill) The fraction of the incident α-particles which are reflected. }

abstract = { In the course of the experiments undertaken by Professor Rutherford and myself to determine accurately the number of α-particles expelled from 1 gramme of radium, our attention was directed to a notable scattering of the α-particles in passing through matter. The effect of scattering is well known in the case of β-particles. A narrow pencil of β-rays emerges after passing through a metal plate as an ill-defined beam. A similar effect, but to a much smaller extent, was known to exist also for the α-particles. Professor Rutherford* showed that the image of a narrow slit produced by the α-rays on a photographic plate broadens out when the slit was covered with a thin sheet of mica, while a well-defined image was obtained in vacuum with the uncovered slit. The question of the actual existence of the scattering effect of the α-particles has been discussed further by Kucera and Masek,† by W. H. Bragg,‡ L. Meitner,§ and E. Meyer.|| Some experiments have been made, using the scintillation method to determine the magnitude of the scattering of the α-particles in passing through matter. The apparatus used is shown in fig. 1. The main part consists of a glass tube nearly 2 metres in length and of about 4 cm. diameter. The α-particles from a strong but small source placed at R passed through a narrow slit S and produced an image of this slit on a phosphorescent screen Z, which was cemented to the end of the glass tube. The breadth of the slit was 0.9 mm., and the breadth of the geometrical image on the screen was about 2 mm., depending upon the dimensions and the distance of the source. The numbers of scintillations at different points of the screen were counted directly by means of a suitable microscope M, of 50 times magnifi­cation. The area of the screen which could be seen through the microscope was about 1 mm.2 The number of scintillations counted varied between two or three a minute and about 80 per minute. As regards the microscope and the most convenient method to count thescintillations, the hints given by E. Regener* in his recent paper proved very useful. The microscope was mounted on a slide PP so that the scintillations produced at varying distances from the centre of the beam could be observed. The actual position of the microscope was read on a millimetre scale fixed to the slide. }
